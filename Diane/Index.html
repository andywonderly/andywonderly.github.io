            My mom always thought of herself as a small-town country girl. She didn’t have
            dreams of fame, fortune, or accolades – she just wanted a life that revolved
            around family. She’d say there wasn’t anything special about her – but anyone
            who knew her to any degree could tell you how wrong she was.
            <br /><br />
            When I think of my childhood, I think of how present my mom was. She was the
            first to volunteer for our field-trips (she was practically our chauffer for decades)
            – taking me and my siblings to our respective practices and extracurriculars, she
            even volunteered to be our lunch-lady while we attended St. John’s. I don’t know
            how she did it, but she managed to get all four kids dressed and ready to go (and
            dressed well I might add– we weren’t wearing our pajamas) and we’d all load up
            into the Dodge Caravan and be on our way – arriving on time or with time to
            spare. She’d pull all-nighters with us finishing school projects and she was our
            original spell-check, well before google or autocorrect. Looking back, she made it
            look easy. And after having my first child, I see it definitely wasn’t.
            <br /><br />
            My mom never gave herself enough credit. She would be the first person to
            downplay her accomplishments – whether she was cooking a holiday meal for our
            huge family gatherings, or baking a cake for a birthday – before anyone could
            even take a bite, she would apologize and list everything that was wrong with
            what she just prepared. She’d say “sorry, the turkey’s a little dry” or “I should
            have added more brown sugar to the sticky toffee pudding dressing” or “I left the
            banana bread in 3 minutes too long, and it’s burnt beyond repair.” I assure you,
            there wouldn’t be anything wrong with what my mom had made. In fact, it would
            be the most delicious thing you’d ever eaten, but my mom would have detailed
            notes on how she could make it better next time. My mom actually had folders
            organized by each holiday and birthday in her nightstand drawer where she
            stored her meticulous notes to refer to next year. She logged everyone’s favorite
            drink, entree, and dessert. It’s hard to imagine why anyone would go through this
            much trouble while planning events. But my mom’s sole drive was to glorify God
            by bringing her family together and making everyone around her feel special.
            <br /><br />
            My mom didn’t only have event notes in her drawers, she had numerous Post It
            notes with bible verses and inspirational sayings strewn all over. My mom
            believed in the power of prayer with all her heart and she stayed diligent with her
            devotions in trying times. She generously took our burdens and offered them to
            God for us - as she often said – “she was only as happy as her unhappiest child.”
            She would write the name of the person and the date next to the verse or
            devotional she felt was fit for that person at that time – and she would pray and
            pray… until the storm passed. I personally went through difficult time when I was
            transitioning from high school to college – I didn’t know what school I wanted to
            go to, I didn’t know what I wanted to major in - I was just lost and filled with
            regret because I felt like I made some wrong decisions during that time. My mom
            wasn’t only there for me - she physically suffered with me. My pain was her pain.
            That’s just how much she loved me. It’s difficult to fully illustrate my Mom’s faith
            – but she would even put strips of paper with bible verses in her shoes so she
            could literally walk in God’s Word. My mom stayed steadfast in her faith until the
            very end. After she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and continually barraged
            with bad news after bad news – I remember her telling me that no matter how
            bad things looked, she was choosing to remain optimistic and focus on God’s
            healing power.
            <br /><br />
            Soon after my mom’s stage 4 diagnosis, my sister-in-law, Penny, was diagnosed
            with Leukemia. Penny had just given birth to her first child, Davey, and she would
            soon have to leave to UCLA to receive treatment. My mom stepped-up during
            this extremely difficult time and she just did what she does best – being a
            nurturing mother. She had my brother, Jarred, move back in along with little
            baby Davey. My mom was 63 years old taking care of a newborn – all the restless
            nights of night feedings and changing diapers – yet she never complained once.
            In fact, I only remember her beaming with joy taking care of Davey (even though,
            there was a blow out or three). And I assure you that my mom was not worried
            about her health issues at this time – she was only focused on Penny getting
            better.
            <br /><br />
            Right before my mom started to show signs of her illness, she was designing a
            playset to go in her and my dad’s backyard. For as long as I can remember, my
            mom dreamed about building a fort or playset in the backyard – but it just never
            happened. This time, she was determined to get one built. She thought of every
            customization imaginable, and took careful consideration of what each grandchild
            would enjoy. My mom finally got that playset ordered and delivered to the house
            a few months ago. It came on a huge flatbed truck with crates of unassembled
            pieces of wood stacked up about eight feet high in the driveway. My dad and my
            brother-in-law, Jack, worked long hours to get that playset up and completed. Its
            official debut was on St. Patrick’s Day, and my mom was able to watch her
            beloved grandchildren play on that playset – just like she’d dreamt of.
            <br /><br />
            One of my mom’s Post-It notes read - “Love the people God gave you because He
            will need them back one day.” My mom made the decision to love everyone
            around her – even when it was hard to do so. I can only hope to love half as much
            as my mom - because her shoes are too large to fill. I wish God didn’t need her
            back this soon, but I was blessed to have an angel like her as a mother. I love you,
            mom, and I will miss you every day. I will miss sitting around the kitchen talking
            about nothing with you; I will miss you calling me, asking me for my opinion on
            every little thing because you were so indecisive; and I’m going to miss the magic
            you created for us in everyday moments. The only source of comfort that I will
            try to hold onto is knowing that you and Nonni are together in Heaven - and that
            you will look after us up there.
